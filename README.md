PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

This program simulates an elevator system that can operate in both single-elevator and multi-elevator modes. It uses two main components: the Request structure, which holds details about each user's request (including the time the request was made, the origin and destination floors, and the direction of travel), and the Elevator class, which manages each elevatorâ€™s state. Each elevator keeps track of its current floor, moving direction, and maintains two queues, one for upward requests and another for downward requests. As the simulation runs, it generates random requests at regular intervals and assigns them either to the single elevator or to the closest or idle elevator in a multi-elevator setup. The elevators process these requests step by step, moving between floors, picking up users, and recording their waiting times. Once the simulation ends, it calculates and displays the average waiting time for all requests served. Overall, the program provides a clear and flexible simulation of how elevators handle and prioritize floor requests in an efficient way.
